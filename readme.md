## 🎯 Usage

### 1️⃣ Run the Complete Pipeline 🚀🔄

- Open the **Jupyter Notebook** `main.ipynb` to execute each step of the full processing pipeline **manually**.

- For a **one-click transcript generation**, use `pipeline.ipynb` — simply update the YouTube video link and select the desired language:

### 2️⃣ Run Individual Components 🔧🛠️
Each functionality can also be executed separately:

- **Fetch YouTube Videos** 📹🔗
  ```bash
  python ScrapYTAudio.py
  ```
- **Convert Video to Audio** 🎥➡️🔊
  ```bash
  python VideoToAudio.py
  ```
- **Perform Speaker Diarization** 🗣️🔍
  ```bash
  python Diarization.py
  ```
- **Run Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** 🎤📝
  ```bash
  python ASR.py
  ```

Alternatively, check the **Jupyter Notebooks** 📓🔬 for detailed explanations and examples.
